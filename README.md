# recipeBook

##Thank you for using the Recipe Book! This is a simple web application to keep track of recipes. To start using the app you'll want to start by running "npm i" in both the server and client folders. From there you can run "npm start" in the server and client folders. If you would like some basic data to start you can also run "npm seed" in the server folder. Now that both sides of the app are running you can open a webpage to https://localhost:3000.  
First thing to note is the search bar on the top of the page. You can input a word there, like "sandwich", and click the search button. The app will return all recipes that contain that word in the title. If you go back to the home page you'll see a button to add your own recipe. When you click it a modal will pop up where you can input recipe title, instructions, and ingredients. Each recipe card also has a "view or edit" button that will take you to that recipes page.  
Thank you for looking at my app, I apologize that I didn't have enough time to implement all the technical requirements. You can filter the recipes on the search results page but the app will only console.log the results, not re-render the page with the new results. Adding delete and edit buttons would be relatively simple to implement, i just didn't have time to do so, the delete route is already done even.
